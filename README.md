# GettingAndCleaningData

This repository contains the project files for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to document and showcase the process of cleaning and analyzing data collected from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The tasks involved in this project include:
1. Merging training and test datasets to create a unified dataset.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.
4. Appropriately labeling the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in the Repository

- **run_analysis.R**: The main script that performs all steps to process the data.
- **CodeBook.md**: Provides a detailed explanation of variables, data, and transformations performed.
- **tidy_data.txt**: The final tidy dataset created by the script.
- **final_tidy_data.txt**: The second tidy dataset with the averages for each activity and subject.

## How to Run the Script
